This project covers very basic but groundbreaking features of Meteor framework. So of its basic features are as following 
  - Template and Layout 
  - Helpers and Event handler 
  - User authentication 
  - Collections
  - Iron Router and Before filter 
  - Publisher and Subscriber 
  - Fixtures 
  - Allow and Deny 
  - Reactivity 
  - Error handling
 I have being working in Ruby on Rails for while but I am deeply impressed with meteor. From above I loved it reactivity features alot. If your requirement is more of realtime you should definatly go for Meteor.
